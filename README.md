# Distributed TensorFlow Example (O'Reilly Blog Post)

There are three pieces of example code here:
  
  * a Spark program to launch TensorFlow functions inside a Spark 'mapper' function. This is useful for hyperparameter optimization (parameter sweeps)
  
  * a TensorFlowOnSpark program that can be used with Hops Hadoop
  
  * a Horovod program that can be used with Hops Hadoop
  
You can get more details on [TensorFlowOnSpark at its github repo](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark) and more details on [Horovod at its github repo](https://github.com/uber/horovod).
    
For details on how to install and setup Hops, so that you can run all three programs in a Tour, go to [hops.io](http://www.hops.io).
